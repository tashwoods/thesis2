This thesis presents a search for $WW$ and $WZ$ resonances using data from $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV using the ATLAS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. Diboson resonances are predicted in a number of Standard Model (SM) extensions, such as Extended Gauge Models, and Extra dimensional models. This search looks for resonances where one $W$ boson decays leptonically and the other $W$ or $Z$ boson decays hadronically. This search is sensitive to diboson resonance production via vector-boson fusion as well as quark-antiquark annihilation and gluon-gluon fusion mechanisms. No significant excess of events is observed with respect to the Standard Model backgrounds, and constraints on the masses of new W', Z', and bulk-RS Gravitons are extended to up to 3.7 TeV, depending on the model. As the dominant backgrounds in this search contain gluons, classifying jets as quark-initiated or gluon-initiated would make this analysis more sensitive to new physics. Towards this end, this thesis provides a calibrated quark-gluon tagger based on the multiplicity of charged particles within a jet.
