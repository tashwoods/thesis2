This thesis reviews a search for $WW$ and $WZ$ resonance production using data from $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV using the ATLAS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. Diboson resonances are predicted in a number of Standard Model (SM) extensions, such as Extended Gauge Models, Extra dimensions, and technicolor models. This search looks for resonances where one $W$ boson decays leptonically and the other $W$ or $Z$ boson decays hadronically. This serach is sensitive to diboson resonance production via vector-boson fusion as well as quark-antiquark annihilation and gluon-gluon fusion mechanisms. No significant excess of events is observed with respect to the Standard Model backgrounds. As the dominant backgrounds in this search contain gluons, classifying jets as quark or gluon intiated would make this analysis more sensitive to new physics. Towards this end, this thesis considers the prospects for adding a quark gluon tagger based on the number of tracks in jets and reviews the calibration of the number of tracks in jets.
