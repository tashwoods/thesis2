\chapter{Conclusions}

A search for $WW$ and $WZ$ diboson resonance production in $\ell \nu qq $ final states was performed using 139 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data collected at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV by that ATLAS detector at the LHC between 2015 and 2018. No excess of events above the background-only expectation was observed. The largest local excess is approximately 2.7$\sigma$, which is not significant. Limits on the production cross section are obtained for the HVT $W'$ and $Z'$ and RS Gravitons. Signal masses below 3.4 (3.7) TeV are excluded for HVT $W'$ Model A(B). Signal masses below 3.3 (3.7) TeV are excluded for HVT $Z'$ Model A(B). Randall Sundrum Gravitons are excluded for masses below 1.6TeV. Future searches will benefit from improved classification of jets. To distinguish quark from gluon jets a jet tagger based on the number constituent tracks in jets is studied in the $\ell \nu qq$ search and calibrated.
