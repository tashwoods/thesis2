\chapter{Conclusions}
The incompleteness of the SM motivates searching for new physics at the TeV scale. This thesis presented one such search for $WW$ and $WZ$ diboson resonance production in $\ell \nu qq $ final states. This search was performed using 139 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data collected at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV by the ATLAS detector at the LHC between 2015 and 2018. No significant excess of events above the background-only expectation was observed. The largest excess is 2.7$\sigma$ for a 1~TeV HVT $Z'$ produced via VBF. Limits on the production cross sections are obtained for the HVT $W'$ and $Z'$ and RS Gravitons. Signal masses below 3.4 (3.7)~TeV are excluded for HVT $W'$ Model A(B). Signal masses below 3.3 (3.7)~TeV are excluded for HVT $Z'$ Model A(B). RS Gravitons are excluded for masses below 1.6~TeV. This search and other ATLAS analyses will benefit from improved jet classification. To distinguish quark and gluon jets a tagger based on the number constituent tracks in jets is studied in the $\ell \nu qq$ search and calibrated.
